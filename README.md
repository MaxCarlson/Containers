# Containers

An in-progress template container library where it's simple and easy to change the underlying data structure of common container types.

Example syntax:

Map<std::string, int, RedBlackTree>

Set<int, BinaryTree>

Map<int, int>

## Current (rough) data structures

### Ordered-Set/Map implementations

Red-Black Tree

Binary Search Tree (not compliant with the template traits yet)

### Unordered-Set/Map implementations

Open-Address hash table - partially done. (No map impl yet)


### A work in progress.
